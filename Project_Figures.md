# Project Figures

## 1. Architecture Diagram
- Description: This diagram illustrates the overall architecture of the application, including the backend and frontend components.
- **Frontend**: Built with React, it includes components for job listings and student profiles.
- **Backend**: Built with Node.js, it handles data operations and business logic.
- **Database**: A database (e.g., MongoDB) is used to store job and student data.
- **API**: RESTful API endpoints facilitate communication between the frontend and backend.

## 2. Data Flow Diagram
- Description: This diagram shows how data flows between the frontend and backend, particularly focusing on API interactions.
- **User Actions**: Users interact with the frontend to view job listings and manage student profiles.
- **API Requests**: The frontend sends requests to the backend API to fetch or update data.
- **Database Operations**: The backend processes these requests, interacts with the database, and returns the appropriate responses to the frontend.

## 3. User Interface Mockups
- Description: Visual representations of key user interfaces for job management and student profiles.
- **Job Listings Page**: A page displaying all available job listings with options to filter and search.
- **Student Profile Page**: A page where students can view and edit their personal and academic information.
- **Application Form**: A form for students to apply for jobs, including fields for personal details, resume upload, and cover letter.
